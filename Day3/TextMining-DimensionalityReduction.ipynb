Although the VDIS came to a close on Wednesday,  declarants have been allowed to pay taxes within three months of filing the declaration after paying interest at the rate of 2 per cent per month or part of the month to be calculated from the date of declaration under Section 67(1) of the VDIS.No cheer in industrial output growthThe incipient recession that has set in during the current fiscal seems to show no let-up or sign of recovery as industrial production during the first seven months of 1997-98 (April-October) showed a growth of five per cent in contrast to a robust 10 per cent growth in the corresponding period of 1996-97. “Quick estimates” of the index of industrial production (IIP) with 1980-81 base show that the growth of industrial production in October 1997 was a meagre 3.3 per cent as against 10 per cent in October 1996.
